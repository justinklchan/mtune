Clinical pupillometers and other high performance pupillometry systems utilize near-infrared light to measure the pupil because melanin of the iris refects longer wavelengths and
appears bright, which signifcantly contrasts the dark pupil. Near infrared imaging is not possible in smartphone
RGB cameras because smartphone cameras have built-in flters that cutof light outside the visible spectrum to
improve image quality for photography. Tis paper addresses the challenge of performing pupillometry within the
light spectrum of commodity RGB cameras.

Head Impulse Test | Peripheral Vestibular Dysfunction
=> has disease if eye and head move together (this is called corrective saccade)

Joint Position Sense Assessment | Cervicogenic Dizziness
can patient move head, and return it to the same position

Dix Hallpike Test | Posterior BPPV
=> inner ear problem, causes vertigo (can be due to ear infection or head truma, debris in cochlea)

Modified Epley Maneuver | Posterior BPPV Treatment

The future of millimeter wave enabled smart speakers
Check the mobicom paper demonstrating you can use mmWave for some stuff. 
How can all of the mmWave capabilities be enabled in smart speaker form
Millimeter wave as a kinect or for in the dark monitoring 
Overcoming short range limitations

----------------------------------

fetal health sensing
seizures
COPD breathing. sleep disease detection.

Millimeter wave

elderly monitoring (gait analysis)
blood pressure monitoring
eclampsia, seizures.

smart speakers in offices and dorm rooms (new deployment environment) --- continuous breathing, cough, sneeze sounds

----------------------------------

Smart home hubs for comprehensive fetal sensing

Challenges:
mmWave -> skeletal pose estimation
	can we pair the radio data with ground truth accelerometer readings? or camera readings?
Generative AI data 
	Have actors act out a seizure -> use this to generate synthetic data
	Combine this with data in the wild
